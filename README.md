## Motivation

During college I had received the wrong schedule for my classes. It was early in the semester and I walked into a class I was not signed up for, but no one stopped me. The class happened to be on 
integrated systems and micro-controllers (Arduinos). From the introduction I was gripped by the possibilities contained within the small plastic box the kit was housed in, and although I did not participate
in the course I swore to one day continue on the path of exploring micro controllers and simple robotics. After securing a job I ordered a ELEGOO Starter Kit from Amazon for myself for christmas and that is where the adventure starts.

## Tools

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [ELEGOO](https://www.elegoo.com) Super Starter Kit UNO R3 Project ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4))
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) for diagrams
- [Citcut.io's app](https://www.circuito.io/app) for diagrams
- Phone for videos and images
- [DigiKeys resistor calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band) for finding resistor values


## Projects Guide

Each project should include at least the code and a simple explanation. 

Since these projects has to do with real life electronics, it also makes sense to document the project as **circuit diagrams**.

As much as possible, a short video as **mp4** of a demo of the finished project. From Uplead or Reset phase, one or more cycles depending on what's needed to show the majority of the features.
