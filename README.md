## Motivation

During college I had received the wrong schedule for my classes. It was early in the semester and I walked into a class I was not signed up for, but no one stopped me. The class happened to be on 
integrated systems and micro-controllers (Arduinos). From the introduction I was gripped by the possibilities contained within the small plastic box the kit was housed in, and although I did not participate
in the course I swore to one day continue on the path of exploring micro controllers and simple robotics. After securing a job I ordered a ELEGOO Starter Kit from Amazon for myself for christmas and that is where the adventure starts.

## Planned

- Hey Jude (Beatles) karaoke on LCD with LED or speaker for beat (from flowchart)
- Thermometer that uploads to ex. Firebase hourly
- Ultrasonic change LED colour based on proximity
- Servo motor
- Stepper motor / 7 segment clock
- Active / passive buzzer
- Ball tilt, other modules
- Control Lego computer though arduino?
- Integrate other electronics
- Send data over Bluetooth
