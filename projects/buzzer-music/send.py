### Plan
# 1. read array of files from molodies folder
# 2. pick melody (can also be done with arguments)
# 3. print melody name? and set beat
# 4. read array of notes and beats
# 5. for each send note with corresponding beat (preload notes then send beats? preload both beats and notes?)
#       - Send notes as Unicode characters, format: decimal (of note or beat) -> hex -> ser.write("\u[hex]".encode()) https://unicode-table.com/en/ https://www.calculator.net/hex-calculator.html or lib
# 6. read beat = 0 to finish melody

# Arduino awaits any input;
# Input from serial: start serial code to play from incoming serial data
# Button press or afer a set timeout, play song from melody folder using old code

# Python terminal aways commands to start;
# With no arguments, prompt argument help print, then play from melody folder in order
# With integer argument, play index that corresponds with melody
# With string argument, search for song name that contains input args
# Print help for overvoew of arguments implementerd
# Print ordered list of songs in folder, with index (ex. "1 - Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\n" etc.)
