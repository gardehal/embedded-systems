# Morning Alarm
 
An alarm that can be used to wake one up in the morning. This is a project focused on the tilt ball switch, photoresistor, active and passive buzzer. It is not meant to be very accurate, but rather to deploy modules in a real life situation. One could convert this to a working alarm, but it is suggested to include a real time clock or some other way to synchronize the projects internal variables to accurate real time.
 
The combination of light and movement surely is the best way to wake someone up.
 
This project did not go as expected and will therefore not be completed with video and will keep the unpolished “work-in-progress” code. The reasons for this is that the real-time element in an alarm was not as easy as expected to avoid. The project might be updated sometime in the future with access modules that can get real time, as well as having improved audio, as the active buzzer sounds way too much like a fire alarm to be used without giving the user and neighbours heart attacks.
